## Campaign Workflow Management System

Business Analysis Case Study

---

## 1. Introduction

The Campaign Workflow Management System is a centralized platform designed to streamline the planning, approval, tracking, and execution of marketing campaigns within an organization.

This document provides a high-level overview of the project including background, objectives, stakeholders, scope, assumptions, and constraints.

---

## 2. Background

The marketing department currently manages campaigns using email communication and spreadsheets. Approval requests are manually routed between stakeholders, resulting in:

* Delays in campaign execution
* Lack of visibility on campaign status
* Miscommunication between teams
* No centralized record of approvals
* Difficulty in tracking historical data

As campaign volume increased, manual coordination became inefficient and error-prone.

---

## 3. Business Objective

The objective of this project is to:

* Standardize campaign approval workflow
* Reduce approval turnaround time
* Improve cross-functional visibility
* Increase accountability and auditability
* Provide real-time tracking of campaign lifecycle

---

## 4. Problem Statement

Marketing campaigns lack a structured approval mechanism, leading to delays, inconsistent communication, and poor tracking. There is no unified system to monitor campaign status across departments.

---

## 5. Proposed Solution Overview

Develop a web-based workflow system that:

* Allows campaign creation and submission
* Enables multi-level approval (Manager → Finance → Final Authority)
* Sends automated notifications for approval/rejection
* Displays campaign status dashboard
* Maintains audit trail of all actions
