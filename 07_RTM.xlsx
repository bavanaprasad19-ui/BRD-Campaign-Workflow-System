## Requirement Traceability Matrix Structure

Create an Excel sheet with the following columns:

---

## 🔹 Recommended Columns (Professional Format)

| BR ID | BR Description | FR ID | FR Description | Use Case ID | User Story ID | Test Case ID | Priority | Status |
| ----- | -------------- | ----- | -------------- | ----------- | ------------- | ------------ | -------- | ------ |

---

## 🔹 Sample Filled Rows (Add These as Example Data)

| BR ID | BR Description                       | FR ID | FR Description        | Use Case ID | User Story ID | Test Case ID | Priority | Status  |
| ----- | ------------------------------------ | ----- | --------------------- | ----------- | ------------- | ------------ | -------- | ------- |
| BR-01 | System shall allow campaign creation | FR-05 | Create new campaign   | UC-01       | US-03         | TC-01        | High     | Covered |
| BR-02 | Multi-level approval workflow        | FR-10 | Route to Manager      | UC-02       | US-05         | TC-02        | High     | Covered |
| BR-02 | Multi-level approval workflow        | FR-13 | Route to Finance      | UC-03       | US-06         | TC-03        | High     | Covered |
| BR-03 | Notification system                  | FR-16 | Send submission email | UC-02       | US-07         | TC-04        | Medium   | Covered |
| BR-04 | Maintain audit trail                 | FR-26 | Log user actions      | UC-05       | US-10         | TC-05        | High     | Covered |

# 🔹 Additional Columns (If You Want Advanced Version)

If you want to look strong in interviews, add:

| Requirement Type | Module | Release Version | Remarks |

Example:

| Requirement Type | Module            | Release Version | Remarks         |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| Functional       | Campaign Creation | v1.0            | Initial Release |
| Functional       | Approval Workflow | v1.0            | Core Feature    |
| Functional       | Dashboard         | v1.1            | Enhancement     |

# 🔹 How to Explain This in Interview

If asked:

**Why RTM is important?**

You say:

* Ensures all Business Requirements are covered by Functional Requirements
* Prevents scope gaps
* Helps track impact during change requests
* Ensures test coverage
* Supports audit and compliance

---

# 🔹 What Most Freshers Do Wrong

They create RTM like this:

BR → FR → TC

But real-world traceability is:

BR → FR → Use Case → User Story → Test Case → Defect (if any)

If you mention forward and backward traceability, you look experienced.

---

# 🔹 Forward Traceability

Ensures all Business Requirements are implemented.

# 🔹 Backward Traceability

Ensures every implemented feature maps back to a Business Requirement.
